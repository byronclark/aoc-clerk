;;
;; The biggest things we need here are maps that tell how to get from one
;; location to another on each type of keypad in the shortest number of steps.
;; I'm guessing it will be important to have alternate paths if they are the
;; same length so we can avoid the empty space.
;;
;; It's easier to do on the d-pad.

;; The idea of robots is neat, but for writing the solution, a robot is just a
;; keypad with a current location that knows how to move. Not sure how that
;; really helps solving this.
;;
;; The part that's throwing me here is that we have to find the *shortest* code
;; across multiple layers. There's a high probability I'll be wrong, but I'm
;; going to assume that if we pick the shortest path on the last pad, then one
;; of those paths will be the shortest on each of the pads going back.
;;
;; Now that I've written that, I think we have a different problem to solve.
;; This is pathfinding repeated multiple times *if* we can still assume shortest
;; path on one layer will lead to shortest path on the next. Lets find out.
